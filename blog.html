                            I created a personal blog site using React to showcase my portfolio, combining modern web development techniques
                            with a clean, responsive design.The site is built to highlight my projects, skills, and experiences in an organized
                             and visually appealing manner. React's component-based architecture allowed me to create reusable UI elements, 
                             ensuring consistency across the site while maintaining flexibility for future updates.

                    1.What is Java?<br><br>
                    Java is a popular programming language that was created in 1995 by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle).
                    It is a high-level, object-oriented language, which means it focuses on using objects to structure and 
                    organize code. Java is known for being platform-independent, meaning code written in Java can run on different
                    types of computers without needing to be changed. This is possible because of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM),
                    which acts as an intermediary between Java code and the computer’s hardware.
                    <br><br>

                    2. Why Java ?<br>
                    There are many reasons why Java is widely used: <br><br>
                    <b>~ Cross-platform compatibility:</b> Since Java can run on multiple platforms, it is often the choice for businesses
                    that need their software to work across different systems. <br><br>

                    <b>Versatility:</b> Java can be used for a wide range of applications, from mobile apps to web development, games, 
                    and large-scale enterprise systems. <br><br>

                    3.Tips for Learning Java <br>
                      ~ Set small goals <br>
                      ~ Code every day <br>
                      ~ Debugging is part of learning <br>
                      ~ Stay curious and ask questions <br>
                      ~ Keep up with updates <br> 
                    ~ Begin by understanding the basic concepts like variables, data types, loops, and conditionals.

                <h1>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</h1>
                <img src="images/oop.png" alt="">
                <p>
                    1.What is OOP? <br><br>
                    Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around data, or objects, 
                    rather than functions and logic. OOP allows us to model real-world entities using objects and provides a modular 
                    approach to building complex systems. <br><br>

                    2.How does OOP work?<br><br>
                    <b>~ Encapsulation</b> his principle bundles the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data 
                    into a single unit  (a class). It restricts access to some components by using access modifiers 
                    (like `private`, `public`, `protected`). <br><br>

                    <b>~ Inheritance</b> Inheritance allows one class (subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from 
                    another class (superclass).It promotes code reuse by allowing shared attributes and methods to be passed down. <br><br>

                    <b>Polymorphism</b> This allows methods to have different implementations based on the object that is calling them.
                    It means that one method can behave differently in different contexts (method overloading and overriding). <br><br>

                    <b>Abstraction</b> Abstraction hides the internal details of an object, exposing only what is necessary to the 
                    outside world. This concept  is useful for simplifying complex systems.
